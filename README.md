## Why MemeLayer?

The meme economy is **$50B+** but has zero real backing. We're changing that.

**MemeLayer** = AI-verified RWA + Meme tokens + Solana speed

```
Traditional Finance → Tokenized Assets → MemeLayer → Memes with Real Value
```

---

## What We're Building

### 🎯 Core Features

- **AI-Verified RWA Pools** - Gold, real estate, bonds backing meme tokens
- **Sub-Second Finality** - Built on Solana for instant trades
- **Institutional Grade** - Audited contracts, compliant framework
- **Global Liquidity** - 8 financial hubs, unified orderbook
- **Autonomous Agents** - AI validates assets 24/7

### 💎 Planned Pools (Coming Soon)

| Token | Backed By | Target TVL | Est. APY |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 🐸 PEPE Gold | Physical Gold | $100M+ | 8-12% |
| 🐕 DOGE Estate | Real Estate | $80M+ | 10-15% |
| 😺 CAT Bonds | US Treasuries | $60M+ | 5-7% |
| 🦍 APE DeFi | Yield Strategies | $50M+ | 15-20% |
